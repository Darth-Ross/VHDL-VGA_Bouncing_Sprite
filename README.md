**VHDL-VGA_Bouncing_Sprite**

This is a hardware description for a bouncing sprite displayed with a VGA screen in VHDL. The repo was originally created to store my school assignment but I also figured someone else might have a use for this.

The source files are located in [projectname].srcs/sources.

The software used for this project is Vivado 2014.3 and the configuration is made for the basys 3(Artix 7 FPGA) development board.

**Technical specifications pending!**
